# Sample

This project was born from a podcast where a <strong>content creator</strong>, who produces <strong>long-form videos</strong>,
		mentioned that he didn't mind if his video got <strong>demonetized</strong> due to the music as long as it was <strong>perfect</strong>.
		The problem lies in <strong>obtaining a license to legally</strong> use music, as contacting <strong>rights holders</strong> and <strong>negotiating a price</strong> can be a <strong>challenging task</strong>.
		Thus, we came up with a <strong>solution</strong> in the form of a <strong>marketplace</strong> that <strong>connects artists</strong> and <strong>content creators</strong>.
		On this <strong>platform</strong>, <strong>artists</strong> can <strong>publish</strong> their <strong>music</strong> and <strong>set a price</strong>. The <strong>uploaded music</strong> is <strong>stored</strong> via <strong>Filecoin</strong>.
		Content creators can listen to the music to see if it suits their needs.
		If they find a piece of music they like, they <strong>can mint an NFT</strong> with the <strong>Filecoin IPFS</strong> link of the music by <strong>paying the set price</strong>.
		The <strong>license</strong> represented by the <strong>NFT is unlimited in duration</strong>. Once the <strong>NFT</strong> is in their <strong>library</strong>,
		the content creator can <strong>link</strong> the NFT to the URL of their video to <strong>authenticate</strong> the use of the music.
		The link is <strong>single-use</strong>, meaning it <strong>cannot be changed or replaced</strong>.
